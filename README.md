# cv
You can preview the CV as a PDF.

This repo contains Donghyeok Choi's LaTeX academic CV, permissively licensed for others to adapt. The CV content and formatting generally conform to Karen Kelsky's guidelines with tweaks for clearer information presentation and better typography.

The CV's TeX file is automatically compiled to PDF and published whenever a commit is pushed to the main branch, via this workflow. This keeps the publicly distributed PDF up-to-date while avoiding commit history pollution from frequent changes to a binary file.
